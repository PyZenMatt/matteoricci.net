Have you ever wanted to build a website quickly, securely, and at scale‚Ä¶ but didn‚Äôt know where to start? Django is one of the most widely used frameworks in the world for web development in Python. In this article, you‚Äôll learn what Django is, how it works, and why it may be your best ally for your next application.

## Why choose Django for your next web project?

A framework is a set of ready-made tools and libraries that help you write less repetitive code.

Instead of reinventing the wheel every time, the framework gives you a ready-made structure to:
  - Handle HTTP requests
  - Connect to a database
  - Render HTML templates
  - Validate data, and much more

## What is a web framework?

Django is a full‚Äëstack framework, which means it provides everything you need‚Äîfrom the database to the frontend.

## Flask vs Django: what‚Äôs the difference?

Beginners in Python often run into two options: Flask and Django.

Here‚Äôs a brief comparison:

| Ideal for               | Complete projects, teams, scalability, back office            | Prototypes, microservices, lean APIs, specific services           |

In short, if you need something ready‚Äëto‚Äëuse, Django is the right choice. If you prefer to build everything from scratch, Flask is a better fit.

## The concrete advantages of using Django

## 1. Built‚Äëin Security

Django automatically protects you against:

- SQL Injection
- Cross‚ÄëSite Scripting (XSS)
- Cross‚ÄëSite Request Forgery (CSRF)

You don‚Äôt have to worry about it: the framework handles baseline security.

## Powerful ORM (Object Relational Mapper)

Django‚Äôs ORM is a very powerful tool that lets you interact with the database using Python, without writing SQL queries.

Suppose you created a blog where you write articles and your model is called Article.

First, open a shell.
```python
python manage.py shell
```

Then import the model:

```python
from myapp.models import Article
```

### Fetch all articles
{: .no_toc }
```python
articles = Article.objects.all()
```

### Create a new article

```python
Article.objects.create(title="Hello world", content="This is my first post!")
```

So you don‚Äôt need to learn SQL to manage your data.

And you can switch databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL‚Ä¶) without heavily changing your code.

## ‚ö° Automatic Admin Panel

Django gives you a complete admin panel without writing a single line of HTML.

This tool is powerful because it lets you browse the database with a graphical interface, which you can customize as you like.

For example, once the model is defined, Django generates a page to create/modify/delete records.

### models.py

from django.db import models
```python
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

## üöÄ Development Speed

Django follows the ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù principle: it has everything integrated. You can focus on your app‚Äôs logic instead of spending time on configuration details.

## When (and when not) to use Django

‚úÖ Use it if:

- You need a site/blog/e‚Äëcommerce/management app
- You want a well‚Äëstructured REST backend
- You have tight deadlines and want to go live quickly

‚ùå Avoid it if:

- You want a 10‚Äëline micro API
- You‚Äôre building only a frontend or a mobile app without a backend

## Conclusion

Django is a complete, mature, and secure framework for building web applications in Python. It offers a solid architecture, an integrated ORM, and ready‚Äëto‚Äëuse tools like the admin panel.

If you‚Äôre a beginner developer, Django helps you learn good practices. If you‚Äôre experienced, you can build scalable and performant apps quickly.
