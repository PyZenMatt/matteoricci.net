Django is a powerful web framework that enables rapid development, but as your application grows, you need to implement best practices to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Architecture Patterns

### Model Organization
Keep your models lean and focused. Use abstract base classes for common fields:

```python
class TimestampedModel(models.Model):
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True

class User(TimestampedModel):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    # other fields...
```

### Service Layer Pattern
Separate business logic from views:

```python
# services.py
class UserService:
    @staticmethod
    def create_user(email, password):
        # business logic here
        user = User.objects.create_user(email=email, password=password)
        # send welcome email, etc.
        return user
```

## Performance Optimization

### Database Queries
- Use `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` to avoid N+1 queries
- Implement database indexing strategically
- Use `only()` and `defer()` for large models

### Caching Strategy
Implement multi-level caching:
- Database query caching with Redis
- Template fragment caching
- Full-page caching for static content

## Testing Strategy

Write comprehensive tests at all levels:
- Unit tests for models and utilities
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

Following these patterns will help you build Django applications that can handle growth while remaining maintainable.
